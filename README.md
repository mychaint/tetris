# Tetris Game

[Tetris][wiki1] (Russian: Те́трис, pronounced [ˈtɛtrʲɪs]) is a tile-matching puzzle video game, originally designed and programmed by Russian game designer Alexey Pajitnov. It was released on June 6, 1984, while he was working for the Dorodnicyn Computing Centre of the Academy of Science of the USSR in Moscow. He derived its name from the Greek numerical prefix tetra- (all of the game's pieces contain four segments) and tennis, Pajitnov's favorite sport.

This project is a [WPF][wiki2] project and was create by me in 2014. Tt is a good drills for me to familiarise .NET frameworks. Compilation and execution of codes requires .NET runtime environment. If you have IDE such as Visual Stuidio would be helpful.
